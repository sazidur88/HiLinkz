The purpose that is better understood and practiced; and is also more requested by clients is to diagnose a problem to solve. Consultants often furnish necessary information or make recommendations based on the diagnosis. Unlike many consultants, however, we aspire to assist the clients with implementation of the  recommended solutions and thus permanently improving organizational effectiveness.</p>

Accurate diagnosis leads to good recommendations of problem solving. Although companies hire consultants from outside for independent diagnosis our approach is to include client team members assigned to the diagnosis process. They, not us, must do the detailed work. We help, we push — but they have to do it. In this way we get key insights of the organization members and diagnose strategic problems in connection with organizational issues. Clearly, when clients participate in the diagnostic process, they are more likely to acknowledge their role in problems, accept and implement the recommendations.  </p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">The engagement characteristically concludes with a written report or oral presentation that summarizes what the consultant has learned and that recommends in some detail what the client should do. Though it may sound like a sensible division of labor, this setup is in many ways simplistic and unsatisfactory. Untold numbers of seemingly convincing reports, submitted at great expense, have no real impact because—due to constraints outside the consultant’s assumed bailiwick—the relationship stops at formulation of theoretically sound recommendations that can’t be implemented. In cases like these, each side blames the other. Reasons are given like “my client lacks the ability or courage to take the necessary steps” or “this consultant did not help translate objectives into actions.” In the most successful relationships, there is not a rigid distinction between roles; formal recommendations should contain no surprises if the client helps develop them and the consultant is concerned with their implementation.</p>
